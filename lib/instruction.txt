now before going to ui design,first let make some constant variable
-create a separate file.

let's create the home page.
you can delete all the default page in the main.dart file

-lets start working on ui.
-change the background color and the app bar first.
-import the constants.dart in our homepage because it has our colors.

-add some demo question
-now create our question widget
-add the question widget to the home screen
-change the styling of the question
-with that our question widget is ready

-create the next question button
-add it to the floating action button
-add some functionality to the button(when you click the next question will show)
 -if there is an error, fix it by adding the conditions.
 
-add the options
  -create the custom widget foe the option.
  -add it to the home screen
  -make it clickable.
  -we also need to change the color when clicked.
  -add some condition to avoid cheating, if the user 
  has clicked then change the color otherwise do not change the color.
  -now that is fixed but we have to add a function for when the isPressed value change
  -now there is a little problem here. 
  you see that when a user clicks the next button then he can  
  go to the next question even though he did not select any option
  we want if the user did not select any option the app will
  show a message that he has to select at least one option to continue.lets do that.

  - let us add some score to show in our app
  -add some functionality to increase the value of score.
  -when the user answers correctly the the score will go up by 1 point.
      -lets remove the gesture decorator from inside the 
      option Card and put it in the parent widget

-let's create our dialog box in the separate file    

-let's add a button to start the quiz from start
  -we need a function to do the working
  -we will create that in homescreen

-start working on the database
   -go to 'firebase.google.com'
   -you have to log in to use firebase services.
   -once login, click on go to console and then create a project.
   -once created then click on 'realtime database'
   -create the database in 'test mode'.

 -let's make separate file for database action.
   - to connect to the database, firebase has it's own package for flutter, but that'score
     too advanced subject. so we will use the lightweight 'http' package.
    -enter 'flutter pub add http' in the terminal
 -let's start creating our functions .
 -fire base understands json data  so we have to convert our question to json format
 -to do that we use another package called 'convert'which is built in dart
-let's try to add a question in database
   -create an object for DBconnect class in main.dart and add a question.
   -hot restart to run the main method.
   
-let's fetch data from the database 

-use the same method we used to add questions

-let's add some more data to database.
let fetch the data
